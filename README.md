# World-Population-Analysis-Using-Python
This Project is About World Population Analysis, it was my first Project,
I get the Dataset from Kaggel * https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/world-population-dataset and I used Python and its libraries(Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn) , in this project I find the number of countries in the world and which continent has the largest area, also I checked which Country has the largest number of pepole, I also concluded and predicted what will happen to the world population in the coming years and what will result from thatfor Analysis, 
I'm so happy to take this step and I will work more and more to produce more projects and to be more efficient.
