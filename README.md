# World-Population-Analysis-Using-Python
This Project is About World Population Analysis, I get the Dataset from Kaggel * https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/world-population-dataset
I used Python and its libraries(Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn) for Analysis, it was my first Project, I'm so happy to take this step and I will work more and more 
to produce more projects and to be more efficient.
